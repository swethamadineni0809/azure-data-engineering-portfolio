# Azure Data Engineering Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Azure-based data engineering pipeline.
The goal is to ingest public data, store it in a data lake, transform it into
analytics-ready tables, and orchestrate the workflow using industry-standard tools.

The project is designed to reflect real-world data engineering practices used
in production environments.

## Architecture
Public APIs  
→ Python ingestion  
→ Azure Data Lake Gen2 (raw zone)  
→ Cloud Data Warehouse (to be decided)  
→ dbt transformations (staging & marts)  
→ Analytics-ready tables  

Orchestration will be handled using Apache Airflow.
